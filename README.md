#### Type 1 Diabetes Research Project: Gradient boosting classifier
Final year undergraduate research project entitled 'Identifying interactions between risk factors for Type 1 Diabetes'

## Background  
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that causes destruction of insulin-producing cells. It is recognised to result from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors. Accurately predicting T1D is important to avoid severe complications at diagnosis and enable precision medicine. Current single-variable models are limited in their predictive power (Fig.1). Hence, exploring interactions between risk factors could extract more understanding of T1D risk and improve prediction models.
